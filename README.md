# Lab-1

This first lab is my lab for the Temperature Conversion problem. In this lab we must ask the user for what temperature unit they want to start with as well as their initial temperature value, and also the unit they wish to convert to. Afterwards, we display the converted value.

I tackled this problem by first making sure that only the inputs C, F, and K were allowed as initial values. Anything else would ask the question again. Afterwards, I asked for a temperature as well as what unit the user would like to convert to based on their initial selection. From there I went and separated the conversions using if and else if statements to make sure that the correct value was displayed on the output.
